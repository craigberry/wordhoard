XML bug fixers.

<p>This package contains "fixer" classes that were used to fix problems and 
irregularities in the original TEI XML source files for the Shakespeare and
Chaucer works. 

<p>These classes are no longer used in the build process. We retain them
as part of the active source code because similar fixers may be useful in
the future when adding new texts to the system.
