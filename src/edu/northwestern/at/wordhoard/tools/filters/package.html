XML filters.

<p>These filters were used to perform a sequence of transformations on
the original raw data (in the form of TEI XML files and Microsoft Access
databases) to produce the current all-XML ingest architecture.

<p>These tools are no longer used in the build process. We retain them
as part of the active source code because similar tools may be useful in
the future when adding new texts to the system.
