<h3><a name="sys" />System Requirements</h3>

<p>WordHoard runs on Microsoft Windows systems, on Macintosh OS X systems,
and on most UNIX systems.</p>

<p>If you use Windows and the Early Greek Epic corpus, we recommend Windows
XP or later. While Windows 2000 and other older versions of Windows work
with WordHoard, some of the Greek characters do not display properly in all
contexts in the program on these older systems, due to errors in the
Windows "Palatino Linotype" font that were corrected in XP and later
systems.</p>

<p>On the Macintosh, WordHoard requires Mac OS X version 10.2 or later. It
does not work on Classic Mac OS (Mac OS 9 systems and earlier) or on Mac OS
X 10.0.x or 10.1.x.</p>

<p>WordHoard  requires a minimum screen size of 1024 by 768 pixels. The
bigger your screen the better.</p>

<p>WordHoard should run on any reasonably modern Mac or PC. Its disk space
requirements are modest. It likes lots of memory, the more the better. One
gigabyte is our recommended minimum.</p>

<p>WordHoard requires a fast Internet connection. DSL and cable modem
connections are fine, but a dialup modem connection is inadequate.</p>

<div class="space" />
<hr />
<div class="space" />

<h3><a name="java" id="java"/>Java Requirements</h3>

<p>WordHoard is a Java application, so you need to have Java installed on
your computer. We require Java version 1.4 or later.</p>

<p>For Mac OS X version 10.3 and above, Java 1.4 is built-in and you don't
need to do anything.</p>

<p>For Mac OS X version 10.2.x, if you don't already have Java 1.4
installed, you should run Software Update to upgrade your Java package to
version 1.4.</p>

<p>For Windows systems, we recommend Sun Microsystem's standard Java
distribution. If you don't know if you have this on your computer, use the
"Run" command in the "Start" menu, type "<code>cmd</code>", and press
the OK button.  A command prompt window appears. Type the following command:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
java -version
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>If you have Java installed on your computer, you will see the version
(build) number. Our sample system in the screen shot below has Java 1.5
release 6.</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/winjavaversion.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
If you do not have Java installed, or it is installed incorrectly, you will
see an error message telling you that <code>java</code> is an unrecognized
command.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/winjavanotfound.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
<a name="installjava" id="installjava"></a>
If you don't have Java installed at all, or if your
version of Java is earlier than 1.4, or if you have problems when you try
to run WordHoard, go to <a
href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Sun's web site</a> and
download and install Sun's latest version of Java for Windows. The latest
version as of this writing is Version 6 Update 17 (aka Java 1.6 update 17).
</p>

<p>
For best results, if you already have an old version of Java on your
Windows computer, remove the old version before you install the new
version. Run the "Add or Remove Programs" control panel and remove both
"Java 2 Runtime Environment" and "Java Web Start".
</p>

<p>UNIX users should check <a
href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Sun's web site</a> for
the proper version of Java for their version of UNIX.</p>

<p>For Linux users, we recommend Sun's <a
href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/download.jsp">JRE 6</a> version of
Java. This version fixes a bug in earlier Linux releases which sometimes
caused unexpected internal errors in WordHoard.</p>

<div class="space" />
<hr />
<div class="space" />

<h3><a name="font" />Font Requirements</h3>

<p>WordHoard selects appropriate fonts on your system to display works in
the Roman alphabet (used by the English language corpora) and in the
Polytonic Greek alphabet (used by the Early Greek Epic corpus). Both Mac OS
X and Windows have built-in system fonts that contain all the characters
WordHoard needs.</p>

<p>You might like to try the Gentium font, available at the <a
href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=G
entium">Gentium Web Site</a>. Gentium was designed for use with
multilingual applications like WordHoard. You can download free versions
for the Mac, Windows, and Linux. If you have Gentium installed on your
system, WordHoard uses it by default.</p>

<p>If you use a Linux system, you should install Gentium. On most Linux
systems, the built-in fonts cannot display all of the characters used by
WordHoard, especially the many Polytonic Greek accented letters.</p>

<div class="space" />

<h3><a name="run" />How to Run the Program</h3>

<p>We use a Java technology named "Web Start" to distribute and run
WordHoard. To run the program for the first time, click the following
link:</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center"><a href="../client/wordhoard.jnlp">Download and Run WordHoard</a></p>
<div class="space" />

<p>When Web Start downloads WordHoard to your computer, it saves a copy in
a special system "cache" directory on your hard drive. The next time you
run the program, Web Start runs it directly from the cache, so you don't
have to wait for it to download again.</p>

<p>Each time you run WordHoard, Web Start checks to see if there is a new
version available. If there is, the new version is automatically
downloaded. So you are always kept up-to-date. You don't have to worry
about checking for new versions yourself, downloading them, or running any
kind of installer.</p>

<p>When Web Start is downloading files, it presents a progress dialog that
looks like the following:</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/web-start-download.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<div class="space" />
<hr />
<div class="space" />

<h3><a name="security" />The Security Warning</h3>

<p>The first time you run WordHoard, a security warning will appear. Click
the "Trust" button. On some systems, the messages and buttons may be
labelled differently, and you may need to click a button named "Start" or
"OK".</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/web-start-security.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>On some systems, you won't see the warning again after the first time
you run the program. On other systems, you may need to take some kind of
explicit action to get rid of the warning. For example, on Mac systems
which present the security warning pictured above, to get rid of the
security warning on future runs of the program, click the "Show
Certificate" button and turn on the "Always trust these certificates"
checkbox. The security warning will not appear again for this or any other
program digitally signed authoritatively by Northwestern University.</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/web-start-always-trust.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
A similar dialog appears on Windows systems.  If you select the
check box "Always trust content from  this publisher," the security
dialog will not appear again for this or any other program digitally
signed authoritatively by Northwestern University.
</p>

<p>
WordHoard wants the same rights as any other typical application
program you run on your machine.  WordHoard needs to establish
network connections to remote servers for database access and
session control, and to allow access to your local disk drives in
order to install itself and store your preferences.   If you use
<a href="scripting-intro.html">WordHoard scripts</a>,
those let you do whatever any typical programming language lets you do.
</p>

<p>
WordHoard cannot subvert any system privileges you already have in
place.  The warning about WordHoard requesting unrestricted access
which appears on some systems is misleading (and unfortunately, we
can't change that text).  This warning just indicates that
WordHoard does not impose any restrictions on system access beyond
those your system configuration sets.
It is possible for a Java program to disallow access to the network,
system clipboard, local files, and so on.  Such restrictions
are useful when writing browser-based Java applets.
They don't make sense for a regular desktop application like WordHoard.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/windows-security-dialog.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
If you receive an error message on a Windows system like
"Missing signed entry in resource", e.g,
"Missing signed entry in resource: http://wordhoard.northwestern.edu/client/mysql-connector-java-3.1.12-bin.jar",
your version of Java Web Start is not handling WordHoard updates correctly.
This problem seems to happen most often on systems running a version of Java
older than 1.4.2, or one of the test releases of Java 1.6 .
</p>

<p>
Try to uninstall WordHoard.  Press the "Start" button, choose
"Settings", then "Control Panel", then "Add or Remove Programs."  Scroll
down the list of programs and check if WordHoard appears
in the list.  If so, highlight WordHoard and press the "Change/Remove"
button.  After a few moments, WordHoard should disappear from the list.
Close the "Add or Remove Programs" and "Control Panel" windows.
You may now <a href="../client/wordhoard.jnlp">Download and Run WordHoard</a>.
You should no longer see the "Missing signed entry" error.
</p>

<p>
If WordHoard does not appear in the "Add or Remove Programs" window,
you can uninstall WordHoard using the Java Application Cache Manager.
Select the "Run" command in the "Start" menu and type the following command:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
javaws -viewer
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>Press the OK button. This should open the
Java Application Cache Manager program.  If it does not,
your version of Java is too old.
Please <a href="#installjava">install a newer version of Java</a>
and download WordHoard again.
</p>

<p>
The Java Application Cache Manager displays a tabbed panel with
entries "User" and "System."  Select "User."   WordHoard should appear in
the list of programs.  Highlight WordHoard in the list and press
the "Remove Selected Application" button.
This uninstalls WordHoard.  Close the Java Application Cache Manager and
<a href="../client/wordhoard.jnlp">Download and Run WordHoard</a> again.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/winjavaws.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
If these approaches fail, please uninstall your current version of
Java and
<a href="#installjava">install a newer version of Java</a>.
You may then
<a href="../client/wordhoard.jnlp">Download and Run WordHoard</a>
again.  You will also need to reinstall any other Web Start applications.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<hr />
<div class="space" />

<h3><a name="desktop" />Saving a Desktop Version</h3>

<p>The first or second time you run WordHoard, Web Start asks if you want to save a desktop version of the program. We recommend that you do this. In the future, you can use the desktop icon to run the program without having to come back to this web page. Indeed, you won't even need to have your web browser running! On Microsoft Windows systems, Web Start also adds a "WordHoard" command to your "Start" menu.</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/web-start-desktop.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Older Windows versions of Web Start may "forget" to offer
you the opportunity to create a desktop version.  You may run the
Java Application Cache Manager to create the shortcuts.  Select the
"Run" command in the "Start" menu, and then type:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
javaws -viewer
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>Press the OK button. This
should open the Java Application Cache Manager program.  If it does not,
your version of Java is too old.
Please <a href="#installjava">install a newer version of Java</a>
and download WordHoard again.
</p>

<p>
The Java Application Cache Manager displays a tabbed panel with
entries "User" and "System."  Select "User."   WordHoard should appear in
the list of programs.  Highlight WordHoard in the list.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/winjavaws.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Select "Install shortcuts" from the Application menu item
(the text may differ a bit depending which release of Java you have
installed).   The WordHoard icon should now appear on the desktop.
If this doesn't work, please <a href="#installjava">update Java</a>
and try again.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/winjavaws-create-shortcuts.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Web Start on Unix systems may not allow you to save a desktop version.
You can always start WordHoard from the
<a href="../client/wordhoard.jnlp">Download and Run WordHoard</a> link.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<hr />
<div class="space" />

<h3><a name="site" />The Site Selection Dialog</h3>

<p>The following dialog appears when you run WordHoard (any time, not just the first time):</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/site.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>Select a site from the menu, then click "Connect".</p>

<div class="space" />
<hr />
<div class="space" />

<h3><a name="loading" />The Loading Dialog</h3>

<p>It can take a long time for WordHoard to load and connect to the site you selected. While it is loading it displays the following dialog:</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/loading.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>The number at the bottom ticks up each second. It can take 5-20 seconds for the program to load, before the first window appears (the <a href="table-of-contents.html">Table of Contents</a> window). As the dialog says, please be patient.</p>
