<h3><a name="sys" />System Requirements</h3>

<p>WordHoard is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start">Java Web Start</a>
application that runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. It may work on some less common
systems that support its dependencies. See <a href="getting-started.html#java">Java Requirements</a>
for more on those dependencies.</p>

<p>WordHoard requires a minimum screen size of 1024 by 768 pixels. The
bigger your screen the better.  A broadband Internet connection is also
essential.</p>

<div class="space" />
<hr />
<div class="space" />

<h3><a name="java" id="java"/>Java Requirements</h3>

<p>WordHoard is a Java application, so you need to have Java installed on
your computer. We currently require Java version 1.8 (also confusingly called
Java 8).  Java is still available via commercial license from 
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/">Oracle</a>, but there
is no advantage to using that instead of the free and open source OpenJDK.
There are various OpenJDK distributors that offer free downloads, including
<a href="https://adoptium.net">Adoptium</a>, <a href="https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads">OpenLogic</a>,
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download-major-urls#openjdk-11-lts">Microsoft</a>,
or your operating system package installer.
</p>

<p>The Web Start technology upon which WordHoard is based is no longer included with any
Java or OpenJDK distribution.  Luckily there is an excellent free replacement available
from <a href="https://openwebstart.com/download/">OpenWebStart</a>; you should install
Java or OpenJDK first, and then install OpenWebStart.  If OpenWebStart is unavailable for
your platform, you may be able to get WordHoard working with
<a href="https://www.azul.com/products/components/icedtea-web/">IcedTea-Web</a>.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<hr />
<div class="space" />

<h3><a name="font" />Font Requirements</h3>

<p>WordHoard selects appropriate fonts on your system to display works in
the Roman alphabet (used by the English language corpora) and in the
Polytonic Greek alphabet (used by the Early Greek Epic corpus). Both macOS
and Windows have built-in system fonts that contain all the characters
WordHoard needs.</p>

<p>You might like to try the Gentium font, available at the <a
href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/">Gentium Web Site</a>. Gentium was designed for use with
multilingual applications like WordHoard. You can download free versions
for the Mac, Windows, and Linux. If you have Gentium installed on your
system, WordHoard uses it by default.</p>

<p>If you use a Linux system, you should install Gentium. On most Linux
systems, the built-in fonts cannot display all of the characters used by
WordHoard, especially the many Polytonic Greek accented letters.</p>

<h3><a name="run" />How to Run the Program</h3>

<p>We use a Java technology named "Web Start" to distribute and run
WordHoard. The <a href="../client/wordhoard.jnlp">Download and Run WordHoard</a> link on our
front page will very likely not actually run the program once it's downloded; this is
a security feature of modern browsers.  You will need to locate the downloaded file
called wordhoard.jnlp, right click on it, and choose to open it with OpenWebStart
or IcedTea-Web.</p>

<p>When Web Start downloads WordHoard to your computer, it saves a copy in
a special system "cache" directory on your hard drive. The next time you
run the program, Web Start runs it directly from the cache, so you don't
have to wait for it to download again.</p>

<p>Each time you run WordHoard, Web Start checks to see if there is a new
version available. If there is, the new version is automatically
downloaded. So you are always kept up-to-date. You don't have to worry
about checking for new versions yourself, downloading them, or running any
kind of installer.</p>

<p>When Web Start is downloading files, it presents a progress dialog that
looks like the following:</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/web-start-download.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<div class="space" />
<hr />
<div class="space" />

<h3><a name="security" />The Security Warning</h3>

<p>The first time you run WordHoard, a security warning will appear. Click
the "Trust" button. On some systems, the messages and buttons may be
labelled differently, and you may need to click a button named "Start" or
"OK".</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/web-start-security.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>On some systems, you won't see the warning again after the first time
you run the program. On other systems, you may need to take some kind of
explicit action to get rid of the warning. For example, on macOS systems
which present the security warning pictured above, to get rid of the
security warning on future runs of the program, click the "Show
Certificate" button and turn on the "Always trust these certificates"
checkbox. The security warning will not appear again for this or any other
program digitally signed authoritatively by Northwestern University.</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/web-start-always-trust.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
A similar dialog appears on Windows systems.  If you select the
check box "Always trust content from  this publisher," the security
dialog will not appear again for this or any other program digitally
signed with the same certificate.
</p>

<p>
WordHoard wants the same rights as any other typical application
program you run on your machine.  WordHoard needs to establish
network connections to remote servers for database access and
session control, and to allow access to your local disk drives in
order to install itself and store your preferences.   If you use
<a href="scripting-intro.html">WordHoard scripts</a>,
those let you do whatever any typical programming language lets you do.
</p>

<p>
WordHoard cannot subvert any system privileges you already have in
place.  The warning about WordHoard requesting unrestricted access
which appears on some systems is misleading (and unfortunately, we
can't change that text).  This warning just indicates that
WordHoard does not impose any restrictions on system access beyond
those your system configuration sets.
It is possible for a Java program to disallow access to the network,
system clipboard, local files, and so on.  Such restrictions
are useful when writing browser-based Java applets.
They don't make sense for a regular desktop application like WordHoard.

<h3><a name="desktop" />Saving a Desktop Version</h3>

<p>The first or second time you run WordHoard, Web Start asks if you want to save a desktop version of the program. We recommend that you do this. In the future, you can use the desktop icon to run the program without having to come back to this web page. Indeed, you won't even need to have your web browser running! On Microsoft Windows systems, Web Start also adds a "WordHoard" command to your "Start" menu.</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/web-start-desktop.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Web Start on Linux or Unix systems may not allow you to save a desktop version.
You can always start WordHoard from the
<a href="../client/wordhoard.jnlp">Download and Run WordHoard</a> link
or by locating the wordhoard.jnlp file and explicitly opening it with your
web start program.
</p>

<h3><a name="site" />The Site Selection Dialog</h3>

<p>If the WordHoard server to which you are connecting offers more than one collection
of texts, the following dialog may appear when you run WordHoard (any time, not just the first time):</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/site.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>Select a site from the menu, then click "Connect".</p>

<div class="space" />
<hr />
<div class="space" />

<h3><a name="loading" />The Loading Dialog</h3>

<p>It can take a long time for WordHoard to load and connect to the site you selected. While it is loading it displays the following dialog:</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/loading.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>The number at the bottom ticks up each second. It can take 5-20 seconds for the program to load, before the first window appears (the <a href="table-of-contents.html">Table of Contents</a> window). As the dialog says, please be patient.</p>
