<h2>Tracking Word Form Use Over Time</h2>

<p>
It is often instructive to follow the changes in an author's
word form selection over time.  WordHoard allows you to
investigate such changes by selecting "Track Word Form Over Time"
from the Analysis menu.  WordHoard displays a dialog which allows you
to select a specific word form and display the frequency
of its use for each year in which an author has published at least
one work.  As an example, we will look for changes in how often
Shakespeare used the lemma "honour (n)" in all his works.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/trackwordovertime.jpg"
     alt="Track word over time dialog" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
The dialog fields are as follows.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>
       <em>Word</em> is the word text whose counts we want to track over
       time.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Word Form</em> specifies the type of word form which
        "Word" is.  You may select
       any word form type, but Spelling, Lemma, and Word Class
       are the most common choices and generally make the most sense.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Analysis Text</em> provides the set of works in which
       the word of interest occurs.  The dates for each work
       provide the time line for tracking word frequencies over time.
       The analysis text must be a Corpus or Work Set, and should
       contain more than one work with an associated publication date.
       The Early Greek Epic corpus does not have publication dates
       for the works, so you cannot sensibly track word use over time in
       this corpus.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Frequency Normalization</em> specifies how the raw word counts
       (frequencies) should be normalized for presentation.
       </p>

       <ul>
          <li><p>
              <em>No normalization</em> leaves the raw counts unaltered.
              This may be useful if you intend to export the results to
              another program for further analysis.
              </p>
              </li>
          <li><p>
              <em>Normalize to counts per ten thousand words</em>
              reports the counts as if each work were exactly
              ten thousand words long.  This is a traditional count
              normalization method in the humanities.  This allows
              the counts in works of different length to be compared
              in a meaningful fashion.
              </p>
              </li>
          <li><p>
              <em>Normalize to average word count in reference works</em>
              reports the counts as if each work had the same number of
              words, computed as the simple arithmetic average (mean)
              of all the works in the reference text.  This may be
              useful if the reference text is a complete corpus and
              the analysis text is contained in that corpus.
              </p>
              </li>
          <li><p>
              <em>Normalize to parts per million</em> reports
              counts as if each work were one million words long.  This
              produces values which can be more meaningfully rounded
              to integer values.
              </p>
              </li>
       </ul>
       </li>

   <li><p>
       <em>Round Normalized Frequencies</em>, when checked,
       requests that the normalized word frequencies for each year
       be rounded to the nearest whole number.  Select this option
       if you prefer not to see decimal places in the normalized counts.
       </p>
       </li>
</ul>

<p>
Pressing then "OK" button with our sample settings yields the
following results.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/trackwordovertimeoutput.jpg"
     alt="Track word over time output" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
The yearly output appears in six columns.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>
       <em>Year</em> is the year in which one or more works were published.
       The exact publication year for some works may not be known -- only
       a range of years.  For example, "A Lover's Comaplaint" was
       published sometime between 1599 and 1609.
       WordHoard uses the earliest possible publication year
       when computing the word frequencies.  For "A Lover's Complaint",
       WordHoard chooses 1599 as the publication year.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Works</em> is the number of works published in the year.
       In our example, 6 works were published in 1592.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Selected count</em> is the number of times the selected
       word text appears in all works in this year.  For our example,
       "honour (n)" appears 65 times in the 6 works in 1592.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Total count</em> is the total number of words in all
       works in this year.  The 6 works in 1592 contain a
       total of 110,319 lemma occurrences.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Mean count</em> is the average number of times the selected
       word text appears in this year.  It is computed as
       the selected count divided by the works count.  In our example,
       there were six works by Shakespeare published in 1592.
       The lemma "honour (n)" appears 65 times in those six works.
       The average number of times the word appears in a work is
       therefore 65 / 6 = 10.8 rounded to one
       decimal place.  This is the mean count value displayed in
       the table.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Normalized count</em> is the mean count normalized
       using the specified frequency normalization method.
       We selected normalizing the counts in terms of occurrences
       per 10,000 words.  To compute this, form the ratio
       ( nc / 10,000 ) = ( 65 / 110,319 ) and solve
       for "nc" to get 5.9 to two decimal places.
       This rounds up to 6 since we requested the normalized
       frequencies be rounded.
       </p>
       </li>
</ul>

<p>
The normalized counts are generally higher for later years,
demonstrating Shakespeare's increased use of "honour (n)" in his later
works.  To make this clearer, we can chart the normalized counts
by pressing the "chart" button below the results table.

<p>
This vertical bar chart offers a clear visual indication that Shakespeare's
use of "honour (n)" remained relatively constant from 1589 to 1601, but
increased after that time.  Peak usage occurred in 1602, 1604, and 1612.
An appropriate followup analysis would involve close examination of
the works published in those years.  You can find the publication dates
at the main <a href="table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> window.
Select the "Shakespeare" tab and then the "Date" option button.
</p>

<p>
You may save the chart image to a file by selecting "Save As..." from
the "File" menu.  You have a choice of jpeg, png, or svg format.
