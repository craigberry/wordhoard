SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

<p>
Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005 PREAMBLE
</p>

<p>
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of cooperative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with
others.
</p>

<p>
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts,
including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and
sold with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are
changed. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any
other type of license.
</p>
