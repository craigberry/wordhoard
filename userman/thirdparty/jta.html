</p>

<p>

terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to
Section 3 (Java Technology Restrictions) of these Supplemental Terms, Sun
grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to reproduce

<p>
2. License to Distribute Software.  In addition to the license granted in
Section 1 (Software Internal Use and Development License Grant) of these
Supplemental Terms, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including but not limited to Section 3 (Java Technology Restrictions), Sun
grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to reproduce

classes in the JPI.  In the event that you create an additional class and
associated API(s) which (i) extends the functionality of the Java Platform,
and (ii) is exposed to third party software developers for the purpose of
developing additional software which invokes such additional API, you must
promptly publish broadly an accurate specification for such API for free
use by all developers. You may not create, or authorize your licensees to

identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or similar convention as specified by
Sun in any naming convention designation.

Agreement.

likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement of any
intellectual property right.
