the license granted in Section 1 (Software Internal Use and
Development License Grant) of these Supplemental Terms,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including but not limited to Section 3 (Java Technology

Platform Interface ("JPI", identified as classes contained
within the "java" package or any subpackages of the "java"
package), by creating additional classes within the JPI or
otherwise causing the addition to or modification of the
classes in the JPI.  In the event that you create an
additional class and associated API(s) which (i) extends the
functionality of the Java platform, and (ii) is exposed to
third party software developers for the purpose of
developing additional software which invokes such additional
API, you must promptly publish broadly an accurate
specification for such API for free use by all developers.
You may not create, or authorize your licensees to create,

any way identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or similar
convention as specified by Sun in any naming convention
designation.

<p>
8. Termination for Infringement.  Either party may terminate
this Agreement immediately should any Software become, or in
either party's opinion be likely to become, the subject of a
claim of infringement of any intellectual property right.
