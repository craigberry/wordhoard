<h3><a name="worksets" id="worksets">Work Sets</a></h3>

<p>
<strong>Work sets</strong> allow you to combine one or more disparate works
or work parts for the purpose of further analysis.  For example, you
can combine all of Shakespeare's tragedies into a
work set, and all of the comedies into another work set.
You can <a href="analysis-comparewords.html">compare</a> the
frequencies of words in each work set to look for interesting
vocabulary differences between words used in the tragedies as opposed
to the comedies.
</p>

<p>
You can also break out each of the individual Canterbury Tales into
its work set.  This allows you to analyze relationships between
individual tales.
</p>

<p>
You can select all of the prologues in Shakespeare's works and place them
in a work set.  This allows you to compare the vocabulary in the
prologues with those of Shakespeare as a whole.  Or you could create
another work set of all the work parts except the prologues, and
compare these with the work set containing just the prologues.
</p>

<p>
In a sense, you can look at a work set as a custom corpus.  You can
mark the work sets you create as private (only for your use) or public
(available for others to use but not modify).  You can use a work set
as one of the search criteria when you
<a href="search-words.html">search for words</a>
to ensure the resulting words come from works and work parts in the
work set.
</p>

<p>
There is no restriction on how you may combine works and work parts
in a work set.  You can combine all the works in Shakespeare, Chaucer,
and Spenser into a work set you might call "English works."  You can even
combine works from Early Greek Epic with English works, but this is
unlikely to prove useful.
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples of work sets you might create.
</p>

<ol>
   <li>Hamlet, Act 1, Scene 1</li>
   <li>Hamlet, Act 5</li>
   <li>Hamlet</li>
   <li>Shakespeare's Tragedies</li>
   <li>All of Shakespeare</li>
   <li>Shakespeare's Histories and the Faerie Queene</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="wordsets" id="wordsets">Word Sets</a></h3>

<p>
<strong>Word sets</strong> allow you to save words which match
specified criteria from one or more works, work parts, or corpora.
For example, you can create a word set containing all the words
spoken by males in Shakespeare's tragedies, and another containing all
the words spoken by females in Shakespeare's tragedies.  This allows you
to <a href="analysis-comparewords.html">compare</a>
the vocabulary of male and female speakers.  As with work sets,
you can mark the word sets you create as private (only for your use) or
public (available for others to use but not modify).
</p>

<p>
You can use a word set as one of the search criteria when you
<a href="search-words.html">search for words</a>
to limit the results to a subset of the words in the word set.
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples of word sets you might create.
</p>

<ol>
   <li>Narrated words in Homer</li>
   <li>Spoken words in Homer</li>
   <li>Words spoken by male characters in Shakespearean comedy</li>
   <li>Words spoken by Ophelia in verse</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="worksetvswordset" id="worksetvswordset">
    Word Set versus Work Set</a></h3>

<p>
Both work sets and word sets may be used as analysis and reference texts
in <a href="analysis-intro.html">WordHoard analysis procedures</a>.
You should exercise common sense in constructing and analyzing word and
work sets.  A work set comprising Shakespeares Histories
and the Faerie Queene is probably not very useful.  Comparing
Ophelia's verse with Homeric narration is certainly pointless.
You can do it and obtain statistically correct, if meaningless, results.
</p>

<p>
How do you choose between creating a work set and creating a word set?
WordHoard handles work sets much more efficiently than word sets,
so you should create work sets when you want all the words in a specified
set of works or work parts.  Only create a word set when you
want to analyze some but not all of the words in a specified set of works or
work parts.
