<h2><a name="displayingwordformlists" id="displayingwordformlists">
Displaying Word Form Lists</a>
</h2>

<p>
You can create a word form list or <em>lexicon</em> to list all the
word forms in a specified analysis text.
To create the word form list, select "Create word form list" from the
"Analysis" menu.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/createwordlist.jpg" alt="Create word form list dialog" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Select the word form for which to display a lexicon from the
drop-down list.  You may choose:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>Case and diacritical insensitive spelling.</li>
   <li>Case and diacritical insensitive lemma.</li>
   <li>Word class.</li>
   <li>Speaker gender.</li>
   <li>Speaker mortality.</li>
   <li>Verse (whether a word appears in poetry or prose).</li>
   <li>Metrical shape (Greek works only).</li>
</ul>

<p>
We have chosen "Spelling" as the word form of interest in the sample
dialog above.
</p>

<p>
Next, select the analysis text from the drop-down list.  You may choose
any available work, work set, word set, or corpus.  We have chosen
Shakespeare's play "Hamlet" in the sample dialog
above.  Press the "OK" button to produce a lexicon of the spellings
in Hamlet.
</p>

<p>
The resulting output table displays the rows sorted in
descending order by word count.  For spellings and lemmata, each row
displays the word form with a second column displaying its word classes.
A spelling may have more than one word class if it is a contraction or other
compound word form.
</p>

<p>
The output table contains a column for major word class when you select
spelling, lemma, or word class as the word form.
The major word class column does not appear for the other word forms.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/createwordlistoutput.jpg" alt="Spellings in Hamlet" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
A quick glance at the spellings in Hamlet shows no big surprises.  There
are 4,877 distinct spellings (ignoring case and diacritical marks)
among the 29,530 total words in Hamlet.  The
most frequent words "the," "and," "to," "of," "you," and "I" could be expected
to be among the most frequent in modern texts as well.  As we'll see later,
looking at the relative counts between two texts is usually more
informative.
</p>

<p>
You may want to see the words which occur most frequently for each
major word class.  Click on the column header for major word class.
The output now appears sorted in ascending order by major word class,
and then by descending word frequency within each major word class.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/createwordlistoutput3.jpg" alt="Spellings in Hamlet by major word class"/>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
To see some examples of words with more than
one word class, click the header for the "Spelling" column to sort the words
in ascending alphanumeric order.  This brings a number of contracted
word forms beginning with an apostrophe to the top of the display.  Most of
these are rarely used in modern English but were common in
Shakespeare's time.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/createwordlistoutput2.jpg" alt="Some contracted spellings in Hamlet" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
The spelling <strong>'twas</strong> is a contraction for "it was."
The spelling "it" has the word class "pn" for personal pronoun,
while "was" has the word class "va" for auxiliary verb.  The corresponding
major word classes are pronoun for "it" and verb for "was."
The spelling <strong>'twill</strong>, a contraction for "it will", has the
same two major word classes, but the verb "will" has the word class
"vm" for modal verb.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at the counts broken down by gender.  Select
create word list from the Analysis menu and choose "Speaker Gender"
instead of "Spelling" as the word form.  Press OK to generate the
following output.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/createwordlistoutput4.jpg" alt="Words by gender in Hamlet" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Males speak almost eleven times as many words in Hamlet as females.
Again, this leads us to wonder if this ratio is significantly different
from Shakespeare as a whole, or from the other Shakespearean tragedies.
We can use the <a href="analysis-comparewords.html">compare words</a>
items in the Analysis menu to answer this question.
