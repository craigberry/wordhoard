<h2>Managing Accounts</h2>

<p>This chapter is for WordHoard system administrators who are responsible
for creating and managing accounts on the system.  Other people should feel
free to skip this chapter.</p>

<p>To manage accounts, you must log in, and your account must have the
"can manage accounts" privilege.  Use the "Manage Accounts" command in the
"File" menu:</p>

<div class="space" />
<h3>Managing Users</h3>
<p>The "Manage Accounts" window contains two panes, one for managing User Accounts
and the other for managing Groups. We will first describe the pane for managing Accounts.</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="images/manage-accounts-users.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>The table on the left shows all the accounts on the system,
in alphabetical order by username.</p>

<p>The "NU" column is checked if the account is an Northwestern University
account, in which case the username is the user's Northwestern University
netid.</p>

<p>The "MA" column is checked if the account has the "can manage accounts"
privilege. Accounts with this privilege may also view, edit, or delete any user <a href="annotations.html">annotation</a>.</p>

<p>In the example above, there are three accounts.
One of them is an NU account, and the other two are non-NU accounts.
One of the accounts has the "can manage accounts" privilege, and the other
two do not.</p>

<p>To create a new account, click the plus button in the bottom left corner,
fill in the fields and options on the right, and click the "Create" button
in the lower right corner.  For NU accounts, set the username to the netid
and leave the password field empty - the system will use the NU netid
password in this case.  For non-NU accounts, assign both a username
and a password.</p>

<p>To modify an account, select it in the table, make the changes on the right,
and click the "Update" button in the lower right corner.</p>

<p>To delete an account, select it in the table and click the minus button
in the bottom left corner.</p>

<div class="space" />
<h3>Managing Groups</h3>
<p>Groups are useful for managing access to private resources, such as annotations.
When a user creates an annotation they can allow or prevent its access for any
Group in which they are a member. This is the administrator's interface for 
creating Groups and managing their membership.</p>
<p class="center">
<img src="images/manage-accounts-groups.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>The pane on the left shows two tables. The top table shows all the 
groups in the system. The bottom table shows all the accounts in the system. 
The pane on the right contains the group editor for the selected group.</p>

<p>In the example above, there are two groups: "English 302" and "Seminar 285". 
"English 302" is selected. Its editable name and membership are shown on the right.</p>

<p>To modify a group, select it in the list of groups in the upper left. 
Its name and membership will appear in the group editor on the right. Its name 
can be changed by entering a new one and hitting 'return'. New members can
be added by dragging them in from the user list on the left. Members can be 
removed by selecting them and hitting the 'delete/backspace' key.</p>

<p>To create a new group, click the plus button in the bottom left corner of 
the Groups table, fill in the group name on the right, and hit 'return'.  
Add members to the group by dragging users from the user table on the left
to the members table on the right.</p>

<p>To delete a group, select it in the upper left table and click the minus button
in its bottom left corner.</p>
