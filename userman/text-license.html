Shakespeare </i>, edited by W. G. Clark, J. Glover, and W. A. Wright
(1891-3) ). The <i>Internet Shakespeare</i>  editions of the quartos
and folios have been consulted to create a modern text that observes as
closely as possible the morphological and prosodic practices of the earliest
editions. Spellings, especially of contracted and hyphenated forms, have
been standardized across the corpus. The text has been fully lemmatized and
morphosyntactically tagged.</p>
