<h3><a name="introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Comparisons tell you whether there is more of this here or less of that
there.  Knowing that individual word forms in one text
occur more or less often than in another text may help characterize some generic
differences between those texts.
Statistics on how often the words occur add rigor and provide a framework for
judging whether the observed differences are likely or unlikely to have
occurred by chance, and so deserve futher attention and interpretation.
</p>

<h3><a name="loglike" id="loglike">Log-likelihood for comparing texts</a></h3>

<p>
WordHoard allows you to compare the frequencies of word form occurrences in two texts and obtain
a statistical measure of the significance of the differences.
WordHoard uses the <em>log-likelihood ratio G<sup>2</sup></em> as a measure
of difference.  To compute G<sup>2</sup>,
WordHoard constructs a two-by-two <em>contingency
table</em> of frequencies for each word.
</p>

<table border="1" width="80%" class="lightgray">
<tr class="darkgray">
<td>
</td>
<td>Analysis Text
</td>
<td>Reference Text
</td>
<td>Total</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="darkgray">
Count of word form
</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>a+b</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="darkgray">Count of other word forms</td>
<td>c-a</td>
<td>d-b</td>
<td>c+d-a-b</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="darkgray">
Total
</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>d</td>
<td>c+d</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The value of "a" is the number of times the word occurs in the
analysis text.  The value of "b" is the number of times the word occurs
in the reference text.  The value of "c" is the total number of words in
the analysis text. The value of "d" is the total number of words in the
reference text.
</p>

<p>
Given this contingency table, WordHoard calculates the
<em>log-likelihood ratio statistic G<sup>2</sup></em>
to assess the size and significance of the difference of a word's frequency
of use in the two texts.  The log-likelihood ratio measures the
discrepancy of the the observed word frequencies from the values
which we would expect to see if the word frequencies (by percentage)
were the same in the two texts.  The larger the discrepancy, the larger
the value of G<sup>2</sup>, and the more statistically significant the
difference between the word frequencies in the texts.  Simply put, the
log-likelihood value tells us how much more likely it is that the
frequencies are different than that they are the same.
</p>

<div class="indentedgray">
<p>
The log-likelihood value is computed as the sum over all terms of
the form "O * ln(O/E)" where "O" is the observed value of a contingency
table entry, "E" is the expected value under a model of homogeneity for
frequencies for the two texts, and "ln" is the natural log.  If the
observed value is zero, we ignore that table entry in computing the total.
WordHoard calculates the log-likelihood value G<sup>2</sup> for each
two-by-two contingency table as follows.
</p>

<p>
<code>
E1 = c*(a+b)/(c+d)<br />
E2 = d*(a+b)/(c+d)<br />
G<sup>2</sup> = 2*((a*ln(a/E1)) + (b*ln(b/E2)))
</code>
</p>
</div>

<p>
To determine the statistical significance of G<sup>2</sup>, we refer
the G<sup>2</sup> value to the chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.
The significance value tells you how often a G<sup>2</sup> as large as the one
WordHoard computed could occur by chance.  For example, a log-likelihood value of 6.63
should occur by chance only about one in a hundred times.  This means the
significance of a G<sup>2</sup> value of 6.63 is 0.01 .
</p>

<p>
Here are the breakpoint (percentage point) values for G<sup>2</sup> for
commonly used levels of significance.
</p>

       <table border="1" width="40%">
          <tr>
             <td>G<sup>2</sup></td>
             <td>Significance</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
             <td>15.13</td>
             <td>p &lt; 0.0001</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
             <td>10.83</td>
             <td>p &lt; 0.001</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
             <td>6.63</td>
             <td>p &lt; 0.01</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
             <td>3.84</td>
             <td>p &lt; 0.05</td>
          </tr>
       </table>


<h3><a name="adjustingsiglevels" id="adjustingsiglevels">
    Adjusting significance levels for many comparisons
    </a>
    </h3>

<p>
When you compute many log-likelihood ratio values some will
appear significant by chance alone.  For example, if we compute one thousand
log-likelihood values, we can expect about ten of them to exceed the
breakpoint value of 6.63 by chance.
This may lead us to accept a frequency difference as significant when it is really
just a chance fluctuation.
</p>

<p>
One way to deal with this problem is to "up the ante"
by adjusting the breakpoint values for the number of comparisons.
WordHoard allows this as an option.  The method used
by WordHoard is called the <em>Sidak correction</em>.  It is very conservative,
particularly as the total number of comparisons increases.
</p>

<div class="indentedgray">
<p>
The Sidak correction computes an adjusted significance level "alpha" as follows.
</p>

<p>
<code>
adjusted alpha = 1 - (1 - alpha)<sup>1/k</sup><br />
</code>
</p>

<p>
where "alpha" is the nominal significance level and "k" the number of comparisons.
</p>

<p>
For example, let's say there are k=1,000 comparisons and alpha=0.01 .  The
nominal breakpoint for achieving a 0.01 level of significance is 6.63 .  The Sidak
adjusted level is 1 - (1 - 0.05)<sup>1/1000</sup> or 0.000051 .  This is
roughly the same as dividing the nominal significance level by the number of
comparisons.  The corresponding adjusted breakpoint for G<sup>2</sup> is 16.4 .
</p>


</div>

<h3><a name="manywords" id="manywords">
    Comparing counts for many word forms</a></h3>

<p>
As an example, let's see how comparing word form frequencies reveals
some properties of Shakespeare's play "Othello, the Moor of Venice."
The comparison we select will highlight lemmata that are disproportionately
common or rare in Othello with respect to Shakespeare's
tragedies as a whole.
To compare the lemmata counts, select
"Compare Many Word Forms" from the Analysis menu.
WordHoard displays the following dialog.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/comparemanywordforms.jpg"
     alt="Compare many word forms"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
The dialog fields are as follows.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>
       <em>Word Form</em> specifies the type of word form to compare.
        You may specify lemma, spelling, word class,
        speaker gender, speaker mortality, verse, or metrical shape.
        Some word types are only applicable to specific corpora.
        For example, metrical shape only applies to certain works
        in the Early Greek Epic corpus. We select lemma for our analysis.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Analysis Text</em> provides the first work or set of works
       to be compared.  This may be a corpus, work, work set, or word set.
       We select Shakespeare's play "Othello".
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Reference Text</em> provides the second set of works
       with which the word form frequencies in the analysis set will
       be compared.
       This must be different from the analysis text.
       We select the work set "Shakespeare's Tragedies"
       as the reference text.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Minimum count</em> specifies the minimum number of times
       a word form must appear in the combined analysis and reference texts
       to be displayed in the output.  Five is the default minimum count,
       which is what we select.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Minimum works</em> specifies the minimum number of works
       in which a word form must appear in the combined analysis and
       reference texts to be displayed in the output.
       The default minimum works count is one, and that is what we select.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Report percents as</em> specifies how WordHoard should
       report frequency percents in the output.
       </p>
       <ul>
          <li><p><em>Percents</em> reports the percents as is.
              </p>
              </li>
          <li><p><em>Parts per ten thousand</em> reports the percents
              as fractional parts per ten thousand.
              This default mode of presentation, traditional in
              the humanities, expresses the
              percent values as frequencies in a normalized
              document size of ten thousand words.
              </p>
              </li>
          <li><p><em>Rounded parts per million</em> reports the percents
              as rounded parts per million.  This is similar to
              parts per ten thousand, except that the values are based
              on a normalized document size of one million words,
              and are rounded to the nearest whole number.
              </p>
              </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       We select "Parts per ten thousand".
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Mark significant log-likelihood values</em> appends asterisks
       to each significant log-likelihood value.  When the significance
       values are not being adjusted (see the next option below), the
       asterisks indicate the following levels of significance.
       </p>

       <table border="1" width="40%">

             <td>Significant at 0.05 level</td>
          </tr>
       </table>
       <p>
       We enable this option.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Adjust chi-square for number of comparisons</em> adjusts the
       breakpoints for assessing the significance of the log-likelihood
       statistics as described in the section
       <a href="#adjustingsiglevels">Adjusting significance levels for
       many comparisons</a> above.  We do not enable this option.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Filter out proper names</em> suppresses the display
       of statistics for proper names.  Usually when you
       compare texts you are not interested in seeing differences
       in the counts for proper names.  We enable this option.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       <em>Show word classes for all words</em> asks WordHoard to
       display the word class for spellings and lemmata in the output.
       If you do not enable this option, WordHoard displays only the
       spelling or lemma text.  We do not enable this option.
       </p>
       </li>
</ul>

<p>
The output of the comparison analysis using our selected dialog settings follows.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/comparemanywordformsoutput.jpg"
     alt="Compare many word forms output for lemmata"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
The header tells which texts are being compared
and the total number of word forms in each.  Othello contains 3,006 distinct
lemmata and 26,312 in all.  The Shakespeare tragedies contain 9,725
distinct lemmata and 230,787 in all.
</p>

<p>
The comparison output contains seven columns, initially sorted in descending
order by log-likelihood value.  This allows you to see right away which word
forms show the greatest difference in relative frequency between the
analysis and reference texts.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>
       The first column contains the word form text.
       In our example, the first column shows the lemma.
       </p>
       </li>

   <li><p>
       The next column contains the word class for spellings
       and lemmata when the "Show word classes for all words" option
       is enabled in the compare many words dialog.  Since we did
       not select that option, the word class column does not appear.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       The next column contains a "+" is the word form is overused in
       the analysis text with respect to the reference text, a "-" id
       the word form is underused, and a blank if the word form use is
       the same in both texts.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       The next column contains the G<sup>2</sup> log-likelihood value.
       Trailing asterisks indicate significant values of
       G<sup>2</sup> when the "Mark significant
       log-likelihood values" option is enabled.  We enabled that
       option, so the asterisks appear.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       The next column shows the (possibly normalized) percent of
       occurrence of the word form in the analysis text.  The sample
       output expresses this percent as parts per ten thousand.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       The next column shows the (possibly normalized) percent of
       occurrence of the word form in the reference text.  The sample
       output expresses this percent as parts per ten thousand.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       The next column shows the actual number of times the word
       form occurred in the analysis text.
       </p>
       </li>
   <li><p>
       The last column shows the actual number of times the word
       form occurred in the reference text.
       </p>
       </li>
</ul>

<p>
The analysis indicates that "she," "moor", "i," "we", "lieutenant,"
"handkerchief," "our", "willow," "it," "honest," "do," "her", "oh",
"think", "wife", "general", "signior", "heaven", "thy", and "devil"
are the twenty lemmata most over or
underused in Othello as compared with the tragedies as a whole.  "She"
and "wife" probably reflect the importance of Desdemona.  "Willow"
reflects the famous Willow Song of Desdemona.
"Moor" and "general" reflect Othello.
"Lieutenant" and "handkerchief" reflect the machinations of Iago.
"I" gets much more use in Othello
than the tragedies as a whole, presumably because of the amount of
interior dialog, while "we" gets less.
"Honest" reflects Othello's preoccupation with Desdemona's faithfulness
and the honesty of his subordinates.  If you continue down the list of
words others pop out such as "jealous", "reputation" and "confess".
</p>

<p>
This example demonstrates just how much looking at simple
word frequency differences can illuminate the text of a work.
</p>

<h3><a name="tagcloud" id="tagcloud">
Visualizing differences using a tag cloud
</a></h3>

<p>
As an alternative to looking at this dense table of numbers, WordHoard
allows you to display the comparison results in a <strong>tag cloud</strong>.
A tag cloud displays words or phrases in different font sizes.  To create
a tag cloud from the comparison output results, select the "Cloud" button
at the bottom of the output table.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/comparemanywordformsoutputcloud.jpg"
     alt="Tag cloud for lemma comparison"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
The larger the text for a word, the higher its log-likelihood value.
This allows you assess at a glance the relative importance of the
overuse or underuse of a lemma.  Words displayed in black are overused
in the analysis text (here Othello), while words displayed in gray are
underused in the analysis text.  WordHoard assigns a font size of 100 points
to the word with the largest (scaled) log-likelihood value.  Words whose
font size ends up smaller than 3 points are not displayed in the tag cloud.
</p>

<p>
Notice we selected the checkbox "Compress log-likelihood value range in
tag clouds" at the bottom of the tabular output.  Selecting that
option scales the log-likelihood values before generating the tag cloud
using those values to determine the size of the text for each
corresponding word.   WordHoard uses a transformation based upon
the inverse hyperbolic sine of the log-likelihood values.  This
helps to prevent exceptionally large log-likelihood values from
dominating the tag cloud display.
</p>

<div class="indentedgray">
<p>
The scaling transformation is defined as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>
scaled log-likelihood value = 2.0 ^ asinh( log-likelihood )
</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The inverse hyperbolic since has the useful properties of being nearly
linear near zero and exponential for large values, with a smooth
transition between.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Even when scaled the first few words may dominate the tag cloud display
so that less important words appear in very small font sizes.  You may
click on a word in the tag cloud to remove it from the display.  If you
click on the words with the largest font size, the font sizes for the
remaining words will be rescaled and the tag cloud redrawn.  For example,
clicking on the words "she" and "we" in our tag cloud above removes those
words from the cloud and results in a revised display.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/comparemanywordformsoutputcloud2.jpg"
     alt="Tag cloud for lemma comparison"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Note that "moor" is now the largest word and that the font sizes for
subsequent words have also been scaled up.
</p>

<p>
By default WordHoard includes all the words in the output table in
the tag cloud.  If you wish to display a subset of the words,
you may select the table rows corresponding to the words of interest,
and then select the "Cloud" button.  Only the words you select will
appear in the tag cloud.
</p>

<p>
You may use the "Save As" command on the "File" menu to save the
tag cloud to a file.  You may choose to save the file in HTML format
so that you can view it with a web browser; as an image file in JPEG or
PNG format; or as plain text (in which case the relative text sizes
will not be visible).
</p>

<p>
Let's rerun the analysis choosing speaker gender as the word form for
comparison.  Here is the output.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/comparemanywordformsoutput2.jpg"
     alt="Compare many word forms output for speaker gender"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Women get more speaking time in Othello than in the tragedies as a whole.
This presumably reflects the importance of Desdemona in Othello.
As a result, men get less speaking time in Othello than in the tragedies
as a whole.
</p>

<h3><a name="oneword" id="oneword">
    Comparing counts for a single word form</a></h3>

<p>
If you are interested in looking at differences for specific word forms
you can choose "Compare Single Word Form" from the Analysis menu.
This displays a dialog similar to that for comparing many word forms
but allows you to specify the word form of interest.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/comparesinglewordform.jpg"
     alt="Compare single word form"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Let's see if there is a difference in frequency for the lemma
"think (v)" in Othello as compared with the Shakespeare Tragedies
as a whole.  Press the OK button to show the results.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/comparesinglewordformoutput.jpg"
     alt="Compare single word form output for Othello"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
The log-likelihood value of 24.9 shows that the lemma "think (v)"
is used significantly more often in Othello than in the tragedies
as a whole.  In fact, "think (v)" is used almost twice as much in
Othello as the tragedies as a whole (32.68 parts per 10,000 for
Othello as compared with 17.29 parts per 10,000 in the tragedies).
This is not surprising since interior dialog plays such a large part
in Othello.
</p>

<p>
The output for "think (v)" is the same as we received when comparing
all the words of Othello with the tragedies.  Oftentimes it is worth
the small amount of extra computing time to perform the full comparison
analysis on all the words even if you are interested in just a few.
You may uncover a result that surprises you.
