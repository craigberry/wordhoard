<h3><a name="introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
WordHoard uses the <a href="http://www.beanshell.org">BeanShell</a>
scripting language as a base.  BeanShell is an interpreter for a dialect of
the Java programming language.  As the BeanShell documentation notes,
"BeanShell executes standard Java statements
and expressions but also extends Java into the scripting domain with
common scripting language conventions and syntax."  For example,
BeanShell allows loose type declarations.  BeanShell also offers
many of the Java 1.5 language extensions even when you are running
WordHoard in a Java 1.4 runtime environment.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the large set of
script functions provided by BeanShell, WordHoard scripting adds
<a href="scripting-math.html">mathematical methods</a> and
<a href="scripting-utility.html">utility methods</a>.
You may access data in the WordHoard database using the built-in
WordHoard object model (see the <a href="javadoc/">javadoc</a> for
details).
These scripting facilities allow you to author analytic procedures
to extend the functionality of WordHoard.
</p>

<p>
If you are not familiar with Java, Sun offers a useful
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/">set of tutorials.
</a>
</p>

<p>
While it is possible to use AWT or Swing objects and methods
in WordHoard scripts, we advise against this
unless you are an experienced Java AWT/Swing programmer.
Each WordHoard script runs on its own thread, requiring careful
synchronization with the AWT event thread when you use AWT/Swing
methods.  If you don't know what that means, you should not try to use
AWT or Swing in scripts.  WordHoard does provide a couple of
Swing-based utility methods (e.g.,
<a href="#scriptoutputtowindow">addResults</a>,
<a href="scripting-utility.html#tableoutput">createTable</a>).  These
methods handle thread synchronization for you.
</p>

<h3><a name="scriptsecurity" id="scriptsecurity">
Script security
</a></h3>

<p>
Please be careful when you use scripts.
A script has access to anything on your computer for which
you have the requisite access privileges.  It is possible to write a
script to delete or modify important system files, for example.  You
should not run scripts written by people you don't know without
carefully examining such scripts for possible deleterious actions.
</p>

<h3><a name="runningscriptcommands" id="runningscriptcommands">
Running script commands in the WordHoard Calculator window
</a></h3>

<p>
You may enter script commands directly into the input pane of the
<a href="calc-window.html">WordHoard calculator window</a>.
This is a handy way to perform short arithmetic calculations.
To display the Calculator window, select "WordHoard Calculator"
from the Windows menu.  For example, to calculate and print the
square root of ten you could write:
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/script-output-1.jpg"
     alt="Executing script commands in Calculator window"></img>
</p>

<p>
The output resulting from the "print" command also appears in the
Calculator input pane.  You'll see how to route output to a new
WordHoard window later on.  You can print the Calculator window
output by selecting "Print" from the "File" menu.  You can save the
output to a file by selecting "Save as" from the File menu.
You can use the "Select all" and "Copy" commands to copy the
Calculator output to the system clipboard for export to other
programs.  You can clear the Calculator output by selecting "Clear"
from the "Edit" menu.
</p>

<h3><a name="creatingascriptfile" id="creatingascriptfile">
Creating and running a script from a file
</a></h3>

<p>
Entering script commands one at a time in the Calculator window
best suited to short calculations.  For more complicated scripts,
you can create a text file containing multiple script commands
using your favorite text editor.  Save the script text
as a plain text file with a ".bsh" extension.  To execute your
script, select the "Run a script" item from the "File" menu.
WordHoard will prompt you for the location of the script file and
attempt to execute the script file you select.  The output of
"print" commands still appears in the WordHoard Calculator input
pane, just as if you have typed the script commands individually.
</p>

<p>
You may also use the built-in WordHoard text editor by selecting
the "Editor" entry from the "File" menu.  This brings up an editor window
allowing for very simple text editing operations, sufficient for
writing a script.  You may select the "Run" menu item in the
Editor window to run the script text without saving it to a file first.
That allows you to iteratively develop a script without the hassles
of saving the file for every change you make.  As an example,
open a WordHoard Editor window and enter the same script command
used above to print the square root of ten.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/script-editing-1.jpg"
     alt="Editing a script"></img>
</p>

<p>
Select "Run" from the Editor menu.  You'll see the same output in the
Calculator window as appeared when you entered the script command
directly at the Calculator input prompt.
</p>

<p>
Now clear the Calculator window output by selecting "Clear" from
the "Edit" menu.  Let's extend the one-line script to find the
square root of ten to find the square roots of each of the integers
from one through ten.  The script commands for this are:
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/script-editing-2.jpg"
     alt="Editing a script"></img>
</p>

<p>
Selecting "Run" from the Editor menu produces the following output
in the Calculator window:
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/script-output-2.jpg"
     alt="Script output in Calculator window"></img>
</p>

<h3><a name="scriptoutputtowindow" id="scriptoutputtowindow">
Routing script output to a WordHoard window
</a></h3>

<p>
The sample script above uses the <em>print</em> method to display
its output in the Calculator window.  You can route the output to a
new WordHoard window instead by using the <em>addResults</em> method.
The <em>addResults</em> method takes three arguments:
</p>

<ol>
   <li>The title for the new WordHoard window.</li>
   <li>The subtitle to appear at the top of the output panel.</li>
   <li>The output contents.  This can be a string with lines of
       text, or a more complicated object such as a Java Swing table.
       </li>
</ol>

<p>
For this example, we use "Square roots" as the WordHoard window title and
"Square roots of integers from one through ten" as the subtitle.
We accumulate the output results in one long string using the
standard Java StringBuffer class.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/script-editing-3.jpg"
     alt="Displaying script output in a WordHoard window"></img>
</p>
<p>

Selecting "Run" from the Editor menu creates a new WordHoard window
with the results:
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/script-output-3.jpg"
     alt="Script output in WordHoard window"></img>
</p>

<p>
How do you decide between displaying script output in the WordHoard
Calculator window, and displaying script output in a new WordHoard
window?  If the output is short, and just plain text, using <em>print</em>
to show the output in the WordHoard calculator pane is reasonable.
If the output is long, or you want to display the output as other
than plain text (e.g., in a Swing table), use addResults to display
the output in a separate WordHoard window.  For a long-running script,
you may want to use <em>print</em> to display progress
messages in the WordHoard Calculator window, and route the actual
script output to a new WordHoard window.
</p>

<h3><a name="scriptoutputtofile" id="scriptoutputtofile">
Routing script output to a file
</a></h3>

<p>
You can also use standard Java commands to write the output to a file.
Let's modify the script above to do that.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/script-editing-4.jpg"
     alt="Writing script output to a file"></img>
</p>
<p>

Selecting "Run" from the Editor menu creates a new WordHoard window
with the results:
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/script-output-4.jpg"
     alt="Script output to a file"></img>
</p>

<p>
You can now open the file "/myresults.txt" with a text editor, such as
the WordHoard editor.  You'll see the same results as appeared when you
wrote the output to the WordHoard Calculator pane.
