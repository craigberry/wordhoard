<h3><a name="introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
To create, edit, or delete work sets you must first
<a href="login.html">login</a> so that the Sets menu
becomes available.
Not all installations of WordHoard allow you to
login.  You will not be able to create work sets on such systems.
</p>

<p>
WordHoard provides four
different methods for creating a work set from the Sets menu:
</p>

<ol>
   <li><a href="#usingworkpartselection">Using work part selection</a>;</li>
   <li><a href="#usingworkpartsintext">Using work parts in a text</a>;</li>
   <li><a href="#usingaquery">Using a query</a>; and </li>
   <li><a href="#usingworksetwindow">Using a work set window</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Select "Sets, Work, New Work Set" from the menu
to choose one of these creation methods.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/newworksetmenu.jpg"
     alt="New work set menu"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
You may <a href="#editing">edit</a> or <a href="#deleting">delete</a>
work sets as well as see a <a href="#describing">description</a> of
the data associated with a work set.
</p>

<h3><a id="usingworkpartselection"
       name="usingworkpartselection">
       Creating a work set using Work Part Selection
       </a>
</h3>

<p>
To create a work set by manually selecting the works or work parts
of interest, select "Sets, Work, New Work Set, Using Work Part Selection"
from the menu.  The following new work set dialog appears.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/newworksetusingworkpartselection.jpg"
     alt="New work set using work part selection"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
As an example, let's create a work set that contains all the tragedies
of Shakespeare except for Hamlet.  We fill in the dialog fields as follows.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
    You must enter a <em>title</em> for the work set.
    The title is a required field.  Each of your work sets
    must have a distinct title.  Someone else may use the same title
    for a work set.  The different account name will distinguish
    the otherwise identically named work sets.
    We'll use "Shakespeare Tragedies Except Hamlet" as the title for our
    work set.
    </p>
    </li>

<li><p>
    You may enter an optional <em>description</em> of the work set.
    </p>
    </li>

<li><p>
    You may enter an optional <em>web page URL</em> where more
    information about the work set may be found.  It is up to you
    to create that web page.
    </p>
    </li>

<li><p>
    A work set may be public or private.  A public work set may be
    viewed and used by any WordHoard user.  A private work set may
    be viewed and used only by the creator, and only when the
    creator is logged in.  Work sets are private by default.  Select
    the check box before <em>Public</em> to make the work set public.
    </p>
    </li>

<li><p>
    Select the work parts for the work set from the tree of texts.
    If you select a corpus or work set, all the works contained
    in that corpus or work set will appear in the work set.  You
    may also select individual works or work parts.  Selecting a
    work includes all its constituent work parts.  You may
    unselect a check box to remove one or more work parts.  A work set
    does not remember the source of an entry.  For example, you may
    include "Hamlet" in the work set by choosing that work directly,
    or by including all the works of Shakespeare using the "Shakespeare"
    corpus, or by choosing the "Shakespeare Tragedies" work set.  Both of
    the latter will include other works besides Hamlet of course.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using existing work sets as the source for the new work set contents
    provides a convenient way to merge work sets.
    For example, if you want a work set containing the romances and comedies
    of Shakespeare, you can select the existing "Shakespeare Romances"
    and "Shakespeare Comedies" as the sources for a new work set which
    will contain all the romances and comedies.
    </p>

    <p>
    For our sample work set, we individually select each of the tragedies
    of Shakespeare except for Hamlet.  The
    <a href="table-of-contents.html">Table of Contents</a> window
    conveniently lists the tragedies of Shakespeare together if
    we select the Shakespeare pane along with "By Genre" button.
    </p>
    </li>

</ul>

<p>
Press the "Create" button to create the work set.  WordHoard tells you
the work set creation succeeded or reports any errors if the work set
creation failed.
</p>

<h3><a id="usingworkpartsintext"
       name="usingworkpartsintext">
       Creating a work set using Work Parts in a Text
       </a>
</h3>

<p>
You may also create a work set from the work parts contained in
a corpus, work set, or word set.  This allows you to "clone" a
work set and then edit the contents.
To create our tragedies minus Hamlet work set,
choose "Sets, Work, New Work Set, Using Work Parts in Text" from the
menu to bring up
a dialog which allows you to create a new work from the works and
work parts in an existing work set.
Set the title as you prefer and specify the existing work set
"Shakespeare Tragedies" as the source of the work parts.  Here we
call the new work set "Shakespeare Tragedies Except Hamlet."  Press the
"Create" button to create the work set, which will contains the
exact same works and work parts as the "Shakespeare Tragedies" work set.
</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="images/createworksetfromtext.jpg"
     alt="Create work set from existing work set dialog"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
The work set we just created contains all of the Shakespeare
tragedies.  To remove Hamlet from the work set,
choose "Sets, Work, Edit Work Set" and select the work set we just created
from the list of editable work sets at the top of the dialog.  Now
we can edit the work set we just selected by modifying the remaining
dialog entries.  The bottom dialog entry lists the works and work parts
contained in the work set.  You will see that all the tragedies of
Shakespeare are checked.  Scroll down and uncheck "Hamlet" to remove it
from the work set.  Press the "update" button to save the modified work set.
Our work set now contains all the Shakespeare tragedies except for Hamlet.

</p>
<div class="space" />

<h3><a id="usingaquery"
       name="usingaquery">
       Creating a work set using a Query
       </a>
</h3>

<p>
You can create a work set using a
<a href="saved-work-queries.html">saved bibliographic query</a>.
Select "Sets, Work, New Work Set, Using A Query"
from the menu.  The following new work set dialog appears.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/newworksetusingquery.jpg"
     alt="New work set using a query"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
The title, description, web page URL, and Public fields are the same as
the other work set creation dialogs.  The last field, Queries, lists
the available <a href="saved-work-queries.html">saved bibliographic queries</a>
we can select to create the work set.  Here we create a work set
containing all works whose earliest possible publication date is 1600 and
whose latest possible publication date is 1610.
</p>

<p>
Press the "Create" button to create the work set.  WordHoard tells you
the work set creation succeeded or reports any errors if the work set
creation failed.
</p>

<h3><a id="usingworksetwindow"
       name="usingworksetwindow">
       Creating a work set using the Work Set Editor window
       </a>
</h3>

<p>
You can create work sets by dragging works or work parts into
the Work Set Editor window from the
<a href="table-of-contents.html">Table of Contents</a>
window or from search result windows.   To create a work set
using the Work Set Editor, select "Sets, Work, New Work Set,
Using Work Set Window."   The Work Set Editor window is initially empty.
When you drag only part of a work into the
Work Set Editor, that work part's ancestors appear in light gray.
You can delete works or work parts from the window by selecting them
and then pressing the delete or backspace key.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/emptyworkseteditorwindow.jpg"
     alt="Empty work set editor window"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Let's create our "Shakespeare Tragedies Except Hamlet" work set using
the Work Set Editor window.  Make sure the Table of Contents window
is visible.  Select the Shakespeare tab, and then select the "By Genre"
option.  The Shakespearean Tragedies are grouped together under
"Tragedies."  Highlight "Tragedies" by clicking on it.  Then drag
the highlighted "Tragedies" to the Work Set Editor window.  When you
release the mouse, the ten Shakepearean tragedies will appear in the
Work Set Editor.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/workseteditorhamlethighlighted.jpg"
     alt="Work set editor window with Shakespeare Tragedies"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Click on "Hamlet" in the Work Set Editor window to select it,
as in the sample dialog above.
Press the delete key to remove Hamlet from the list of works.  Now the
Editor window contains only the nine remaining Shakespearean tragedies.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/workseteditorwindowminushamlet.jpg"
     alt="Work set editor window with Shakespeare Tragedies except Hamlet"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
You may save this work set using the "Save Work Set" menu item
in the File menu.
</p>

<h3><a id="editing" name="editing">Editing a work set</a></h3>

<p>
You can edit work sets you create in two ways.
The first is to select "Sets, Work, Edit Work Set" from the menu.
The edit work set dialog appears.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/editworkset.jpg"
     alt="Edit work set dialog"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
The top panel of the dialog lists the work sets which you are allowed
to edit.  You can only edit public or private work sets which you
have created.  You cannot edit work sets belonging to others.
Select the work set you wish to edit.  The remaining fields in the dialog
change to reflect the current values in the selected work set.
For example, select our "Shakespeare Tragedies Except Hamlet"
work set.  The title, description, web page, public flag, and checked list
of work parts for that work set now appear in the dialog.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/editworksettragediesminushamlet.jpg"
     alt="Edit Shakespeare Tragedies Except Hamlet work set"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
You may change the title, description, web page URL, and public flag by
entering new values.  You may change the work parts included in the work set
by selecting or unselecting the check boxes next to work parts in the
bottom panel in the dialog.  Press the "Update" button to save any
changes you make.
</p>

<p>
The second way to edit a work set is using the Work Set Editor window.
Select "File, Open Work Set" from the menu.   Choose the work set you
wish to edit from the list.  The list contains all public and your
private work sets.  You can select a work set that does not belong
to you.  You will not be able to replace someone else's work set,
but you can use it as a starting point for creating your own.
</p>

<p>
For example, we can create our "Shakespeare Tragedies Except Hamlet"
work set by selecting the "Shakespeare Tragedies" work set from the list.
This displays the same Work Set Editor window listing the contents of the
"Shakespeare Tragedies" work set as we saw above when
using the Work Set Editor to create the "Shakespeare Tragedies Except
Hamlet" work set from scratch.  Click on "Hamlet" in the Work Set
Editor window, press the backspace or delete key to remove Hamlet,
and select "File, Save Work Set" from the menu to save your newly
created/edited work set.
</p>

<h3><a id="deleting" name="deleting">Deleting a work set</a></h3>

<p>
You may delete one or more of the work sets you have created by
selecting "Sets, Work, Delete Work Set" from the menu.
The Delete Work Sets dialog appears with the names of your work sets.
If you have not created any work sets, WordHoard displays a
message to that effect instead.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/deleteworksets.jpg"
     alt="Delete work sets dialog"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Select the check box next to each work set you want to delete so
that a check mark appears in the box.
In the sample dialog above we select
"Shakespeare Tragedies Except Hamlet" for deletion
by toggling the check box next to it.
Press the Delete button to delete the selected work sets.
</p>

<p>
Please be careful.  Once you
delete a work set, it cannot be recovered.  You will need to recreate
the work set if you want to use it again.
</p>

<h3><a id="describing" name="describing">Describing a work set</a></h3>

<p>
You may see a brief summary of the data associated with a work set by
selecting "Sets, Work, Describe Work Set" from the menu.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/worksetdescribe.jpg"
     alt="Describe work set dialog"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
Select the work set whose description you want and press the Describe
button.  Let's select our "Shakespeare Tragedies Except Hamlet"
work set.
</p>

<div class="space" />
<p class="center">
<img src="images/worksetdescribeoutput.jpg"
     alt="Describe work set output"></img>
</p>
<div class="space" />

<p>
In addition to the fields entered when the work set was created,
the description includes the creation and last modification time,
the account name for the work set's owner, and the total number
of works and work parts contained in the work set.
